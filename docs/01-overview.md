# Overview

Gofs (Go Full Stack) is a lightweight Go module template for building web apps with a Go-based frontend and backend. It includes reusable middleware, frontend components, and productivity tools to streamline development. Designed with minimal dependencies, it leverages Go’s stability and standard library, providing best-practice code as a starting point.

# Philosophy

### Tackling Volatility

Modern development is burdened by fast-changing technologies. Upgrades in frameworks (e.g. .NET Framework to Core) and languages (e.g. Python 2 to 3) can force costly rewrites. Gofs avoids this by relying on stable, backward-compatible technologies.

### Minimizing dependencies

Excessive dependencies introduce security risks and compatibility issues. Gofs keeps the stack lean, eliminating [dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell) common in ecosystems like Node.js.

### Avoiding Bloated Frameworks

Frameworks often become bloated, hiding simple logic behind complex abstractions. They obscure core principles, leading developers—particularly juniors—to rely on abstractions rather than learning core concepts. Often the code they hide is simple to write, and by writing the code, a developer can include only the parts of code they need while maintaining full control and understanding of the codebase.

# Gofs

Gofs is a response to these problems. It is more than a template or toolset—it’s a mindset that empowers developers to continuously learn and write beautiful code.
